## What Do We Eat?

Think about what you ate yesterday. Maybe you had roti, sabzi, and dal for lunch. Perhaps idli and coconut chutney for breakfast. Or rice and sambar. Or parathas with curd.

Now think about what your friend in another part of India ate. A child in Kerala might have had puttu with kadala curry. A child in Gujarat might have had thepla with aamras. A child in West Bengal might have had rice with fish curry and mustard.

India is a land of incredible food diversity. Every state, every region, every community has its own special foods — shaped by the climate, the crops grown there, the season, and hundreds of years of tradition.

But here is something interesting — **all this variety actually gives our bodies the same essential things it needs to stay healthy.**

> **Key idea:** Different foods may look, taste, and smell very different, but they all provide our body with nutrients — the useful substances our body needs to work, grow, and stay healthy.

## Components of Food

Scientists have found that every food we eat is made up of some key components. These components — called **nutrients** — each do a specific job in our body.

### Carbohydrates — Our Main Source of Energy

Carbohydrates give us energy to run, play, think, and breathe. They are the body's preferred fuel.

- Found in: rice, roti (wheat), bread, potatoes, maize, sugar, banana, sweet potato
- A meal without carbohydrates will leave you feeling tired and weak

### Fats — Stored Energy and Warmth

Fats also give us energy — more than carbohydrates in fact. They help keep us warm, protect our organs, and help our body absorb certain vitamins.

- Found in: butter, ghee, oil, nuts (groundnuts, cashews), coconut, milk, cheese, egg yolk

> Too much fat can be unhealthy, but some fat is essential. Our brain itself is largely made of fat!

### Proteins — Building Blocks of the Body

Proteins build and repair our body. Our muscles, skin, hair, nails, and many important chemicals in our body are all made of proteins.

- Found in: dal (lentils), pulses (rajma, chana, moong), eggs, milk, paneer, fish, meat, soya
- Children need more protein because their bodies are growing

> When you recover from an illness, your body uses extra protein to repair damaged cells. That's why doctors sometimes ask sick people to eat more dal and eggs.

### Vitamins — Keeping the Body Working Properly

Vitamins are needed in tiny amounts but are extremely important. Without them, our body cannot work properly.

| Vitamin | What it does | Where to find it |
|---------|--------------|-----------------|
| Vitamin A | Good eyesight, healthy skin | Carrots, spinach, mango, egg |
| Vitamin B1 (Thiamine) | Helps release energy from food | Whole grains, pulses, groundnuts |
| Vitamin C | Heals wounds, fights infections | Amla, lemon, orange, guava |
| Vitamin D | Strong bones and teeth | Sunlight, egg, fish, milk |

> **Amla (Indian gooseberry)** is one of the richest natural sources of Vitamin C in the world — much more than an orange!

### Minerals — For Strong Bones and Blood

Like vitamins, minerals are needed in small amounts but play vital roles.

- **Calcium** — Strong bones and teeth. Found in: milk, curd, paneer, ragi, sesame seeds
- **Iron** — Makes haemoglobin in blood that carries oxygen. Found in: spinach (palak), jaggery (gur), green vegetables, dates
- **Iodine** — Helps the thyroid gland work properly. Found in: iodised salt, seafood

> Iron deficiency causes **anaemia** — you feel weak and tired because your blood cannot carry enough oxygen.

### Roughage (Dietary Fibre) — Keeping the Digestive System Healthy

Roughage is the part of plant food that our body cannot digest. It might sound useless — but it is very important!

- Roughage helps food move through our intestines properly
- Prevents constipation
- Found in: whole grains, fruits (with skin), vegetables, sprouts, pulses

> White rice and white bread have had the roughage removed. Brown rice and whole wheat roti have roughage intact — that's why they are healthier.

### Water — The Most Essential Nutrient

We can survive weeks without food, but only a few days without water. Water makes up about 70% of our body.

- Carries nutrients throughout the body
- Flushes out waste through urine and sweat
- Regulates body temperature
- Found in: all drinks, and in most fruits and vegetables too

> Thirst is a signal your body is already slightly dehydrated. Don't wait until you're very thirsty — keep sipping water through the day.

## How to Test Food for Its Components

Scientists have developed simple tests to find out what nutrients are present in a food. You can do some of these at home or in school!

### Test 1: Starch Test (Using Iodine Solution)

**What you need:** Iodine solution, the food to test

**What to do:**
1. Put a small piece of food on a plate
2. Add a few drops of iodine solution on it

**Result:**
- If the food turns **blue-black** → it contains starch (a type of carbohydrate)
- If the colour does not change → no starch

**Try it on:** boiled potato, cooked rice, bread, banana → all will turn blue-black
**Try it on:** oil or onion → will NOT turn blue-black

### Test 2: Fat Test (Using Paper)

**What you need:** Plain paper, the food to test

**What to do:**
1. Rub the food on a piece of paper
2. Hold the paper up to light after a few minutes

**Result:**
- If there is a **translucent (oily) patch** → the food contains fat
- No patch → no fat

**Try it on:** groundnut, butter, oil → will leave an oily patch
**Try it on:** apple or bread → will not leave an oily patch

### Test 3: Protein Test (Using Copper Sulphate and Caustic Soda / Sodium Hydroxide)

This test is usually done in a laboratory with teacher supervision.

**What to do:**
1. Dissolve the food in water
2. Add a few drops of copper sulphate solution
3. Add a few drops of caustic soda (sodium hydroxide)

**Result:**
- If the solution turns **violet or purple** → protein is present

**Note:** This test involves chemicals that must be handled carefully. Always do this test with a teacher.

## Balanced Diet and Millets

Eating just one type of food is not enough. Our body needs all nutrients — carbohydrates, proteins, fats, vitamins, minerals, roughage, and water — in the right amounts every day.

A meal that provides all these nutrients in the right amounts is called a **balanced diet**.

A simple way to think about a balanced diet:
- **Half the plate** — vegetables and fruits (vitamins, minerals, roughage)
- **Quarter the plate** — cereals and grains (carbohydrates, energy)
- **Quarter the plate** — pulses, dal, eggs, or dairy (protein)
- **A little fat** — ghee, oil, nuts

### Millets — The Nutritious Ancient Grains of India

Millets are grains that have been grown in India for thousands of years. They are extremely nutritious and suited to dry farming — they need very little water compared to rice or wheat.

Common millets:

| Millet | Local name | Why it's great |
|--------|-----------|----------------|
| Jowar | Sorghum | Rich in iron and calcium |
| Bajra | Pearl millet | High in protein and iron |
| Ragi | Finger millet | Highest calcium content of all cereals — great for bones |
| Foxtail millet | Kangni | High in fibre, good for digestion |

> Ragi is so rich in calcium that it is often given to babies in South India as their first solid food — and to elderly people to prevent osteoporosis.

The Indian government has called millets **"Nutri-cereals"** to encourage people to eat more of them. The United Nations declared 2023 as the **International Year of Millets**, recognising their nutritional and environmental value.

## Food Miles

Here is an interesting question: **Where does your food come from?**

An apple you buy in a city might have travelled from Himachal Pradesh — hundreds of kilometres away. A packet of cashews might have come from Kerala. Basmati rice from Punjab. A mango from Andhra Pradesh.

The distance food travels from the farm where it was grown to the plate where it is eaten is called **food miles**.

Why do food miles matter?

- **Freshness**: Food that travels a long distance is often picked before it is ripe so it doesn't spoil. Local food can be harvested when ripe and tastes better.
- **Nutrition**: Some nutrients (especially vitamins) reduce during long storage and transportation.
- **Environment**: Transporting food in trucks, ships, and aeroplanes uses fuel and releases greenhouse gases.

> **Buying local food** — from your nearby market or from farmers in your region — means less food miles, fresher food, and less pollution. It also supports local farmers.

Traditional Indian food was almost entirely local — people ate what grew in their region in that season. This was not just convenient; it was actually healthier and more sustainable.
