          "answer": "Examples: Idli-sambar from Tamil Nadu, Rajma-chawal from North India, Puttu with kadala curry from Kerala, Thepla from Gujarat. This diversity is a strength because different foods provide different nutrients. Traditional foods are usually made from locally grown ingredients suited to the climate, which means they are nutritious, fresh, and sustainable. Different regional foods together cover a wide range of vitamins, minerals, and other nutrients.",
          "explanation": "India's food diversity is not just cultural richness — it reflects generations of wisdom about using local ingredients in the best possible way. Traditional diets are often more nutritionally complete than modern processed foods."

          "answer": "The child eating a variety of foods is likely to be healthier. Rice provides carbohydrates for energy. Dal provides protein for growth and repair. But vegetables and fruits provide essential vitamins (like Vitamin A, C) and minerals (iron, calcium) that rice and dal cannot provide adequately on their own. Eggs add more protein and Vitamin D. A diet with only rice and dal may lead to deficiencies — for example, lack of Vitamin C could cause scurvy, and lack of iron could cause anaemia. Variety ensures all nutrients are covered.",
          "explanation": "No single food provides all nutrients in the right amounts. A balanced diet requires a variety of food groups eaten regularly. Traditional Indian thali — with roti/rice, dal, sabzi, curd, salad — was designed this way instinctively, even before nutrition science existed."

Carries nutrients throughout the body via blood. 2. Removes waste through urine and sweat. 3. Regulates body temperature. 4. Makes up about 70% of our body. All chemical reactions in the body take place in water.",

          "answer": "No, this is not a good idea. While eating too much fat is unhealthy, removing fat entirely is also harmful. Fats: 1. Provide energy — more than carbohydrates per gram. 2. Keep us warm by insulating the body. 3. Protect organs like the kidneys and heart. 4. Help the body absorb fat-soluble vitamins (A, D, E, K). 5. Our brain is largely made of fat. The key is to eat the right amount and the right type of fat — like ghee, nuts, and coconut oil in moderation — rather than eating no fat at all.",
          "explanation": "Nutrition is about balance, not elimination. Every nutrient has a role. Problems arise from excess or deficiency, not from including all nutrients in sensible amounts. Blindly removing a food group based on incomplete information is a common nutrition mistake."

          "answer": "It contains starch",

Riya can conclude that potato is a starchy food and provides carbohydrates for energy, while onion does not have significant starch.",
          "explanation": "The iodine test is a reliable indicator of starch. Potatoes are one of the richest starch sources. Onions contain sugars and other nutrients but not starch — that's why they don't react with iodine."

Fat is insoluble in water but it seeps into paper and leaves a translucent patch. The advantage is accessibility — you don't need a laboratory or special equipment. It is a good example of a simple scientific test anyone can perform.",
          "explanation": "Simple tests are valuable in science because they make testing accessible to everyone. The paper test is not as precise as a chemical analysis, but it is reliable enough to detect the presence or absence of fat in everyday food."

Apple does not turn blue-black; groundnut does not turn blue-black either. What can Arjun conclude about each food's nutritional content? Why is it useful to run more than one test?",
          "answer": "Arjun can conclude: Groundnut contains fat (oily patch on paper) but not starch (no colour change with iodine). Apple contains neither fat nor starch (no reactions in either test). However, this does not mean apple has no nutrients — it could contain vitamins, minerals, and natural sugars not detected by these tests. Running more than one test gives a more complete picture of a food's nutrients. A single test can only detect one nutrient. Multiple tests help avoid wrong conclusions about a food being 'nutritious' or 'not nutritious' based on only one test.",
          "explanation": "Science requires looking at evidence from multiple sources before drawing conclusions. A food might fail one test but still be highly nutritious in another way. This is why nutritionists analyse foods for many components — not just one."

          "answer": "Processed foods are typically high in refined carbohydrates (white flour, sugar) and unhealthy fats, but low in protein, vitamins, minerals, and roughage. Eating them instead of millets, pulses, and vegetables means: 1. Less protein — muscles and body cannot repair properly. 2. Less fibre — digestion problems, constipation. 3. Less iron and calcium — risk of anaemia and weak bones. 4. Less vitamins — risk of deficiency diseases. Millets like ragi, bajra, and jowar are rich in calcium, iron, protein, and fibre — all of which processed food lacks. Traditional diets built around millets, dal, and seasonal vegetables were more balanced than modern diets built around ultra-processed foods.",
          "explanation": "Lifestyle diseases like obesity, diabetes, and anaemia are increasing in India, partly because of the shift from traditional nutritious foods to processed ones. Understanding what our food actually contains — and what it lacks — helps us make better choices."

          "answer": "Fruits meant for long-distance transport are often picked before they are fully ripe so they don't spoil during the journey. They ripen artificially after picking. Naturally ripened fruits develop their full sweetness and flavour while still on the plant. Fruits with high food miles also lose some nutrients (especially Vitamin C) during the days or weeks they spend in storage and transport. That's why fruit from a local market or farm often tastes much better — it was allowed to ripen naturally and didn't travel far.",
          "explanation": "Flavour and nutrition in fruits both peak at natural ripeness. Long supply chains break this connection between farm-ripe produce and the consumer. Understanding food miles helps explain many everyday food experiences."

In summer, people in Maharashtra ate mangoes grown locally in the Konkan region — not imported mangoes. 2. In winter, people in North India ate mustard greens (sarson) and radish grown in local fields — not imported greens. Food was preserved using traditional methods (pickling, drying) to last through seasons, rather than transported from far away. This meant very low food miles naturally, without anyone planning it.",
          "explanation": "Traditional food systems were inherently sustainable because they were based on local seasonal eating. 'Eat what grows near you, in the season it grows' is a principle that modern nutrition and environmental science now strongly supports."

          "answer": "From all three perspectives — nutrition, taste, and environment — the Himachal Pradesh apple is the better choice. Nutrition: Local apples can be harvested riper and retain more vitamins (especially Vitamin C, which reduces during long storage). Taste: Naturally ripened local apples taste better than those picked early for long-distance transport. Environment: New Zealand apples travel thousands of kilometres by ship and truck, releasing significant greenhouse gases. Himachal Pradesh apples travel a much shorter distance within India — far fewer food miles and much lower carbon footprint. The only reason to choose the New Zealand apple might be if it were a different variety not available locally — but for the same price and same type, local is clearly better on all counts.",
          "explanation": "Food miles is not the only consideration — sometimes an imported food is the only source of a specific nutrient. But when locally grown options are available, they are almost always better nutritionally, for flavour, and for the environment. Making informed food choices is a form of mindful eating."
