## Why Do We Need to Separate Things?

Look around your kitchen. Rice mixed with small stones. Wheat flour mixed with bran. Juice with seeds in it. Sand mixed with water in a muddy puddle.

In everyday life, many of the things we use are **mixtures** — two or more substances mixed together. Most of the time, we do not want all the parts together. We need to **separate** them to get what is useful.

For example:
- We pick stones out of rice before cooking.
- We strain tea leaves from tea before drinking.
- A goldsmith separates gold from other metals.
- A farmer separates grain from the stalks after harvesting.

> **Key idea:** Separation is needed to remove unwanted parts, to get a pure substance, or to get two useful parts from a mixture.

## Some Important Terms

| Term | Meaning |
| ---- | ------- |
| **Mixture** | Two or more substances mixed together (but not chemically combined) |
| **Component** | Each individual substance in a mixture |
| **Soluble** | A substance that dissolves in a liquid (like salt in water) |
| **Insoluble** | A substance that does NOT dissolve in a liquid (like sand in water) |
| **Filtrate** | The liquid that passes through a filter |
| **Residue** | The solid that remains behind on the filter |

## Method 1 — Hand-picking

**Hand-picking** means using your fingers to pick out unwanted pieces from a mixture.

*Examples:*
- Picking out small stones and husks from rice or dal before cooking.
- Picking out rotten fruits from a basket of good fruits.
- Picking out weeds from a vegetable garden.

**When is it used?** When the unwanted pieces are **large enough to see and pick**, and when there are not too many of them.

**Limitation:** It is slow and only works when the pieces are large and few.

---

## Method 2 — Threshing

After a crop like wheat or rice is harvested, the grain (seeds) is still attached to the stalk. **Threshing** is the process of separating grain from the stalks.

*How it is done:*
- Traditionally, farmers beat the stalks on a hard surface or a wooden frame. The grain falls off.
- Today, machines called **threshers** do this quickly and efficiently.
- Even at home — you can thrash a bunch of grapes to remove the berries from the stem.

**Principle used:** The grain and the stalks differ in how tightly they are attached — beating or shaking separates them.

---

## Method 3 — Winnowing

After threshing, the grain and the chaff (broken stalks and husk) are still mixed. **Winnowing** separates them using wind (or blowing air).

*How it works:*
1. The farmer holds a flat basket (soop) full of the grain-chaff mixture.
2. They slowly pour the mixture from a height in a gentle breeze (or blow air using a fan).
3. The **chaff is light** — it gets blown away to one side.
4. The **grain is heavy** — it falls straight down and collects in a pile.

*You can try this at home with rice and small pieces of paper!*

**Principle used:** The two components differ in **weight (density)**. Wind blows away the lighter one.

---

## Method 4 — Sieving

**Sieving** separates particles of different sizes using a **sieve** (a mesh or strainer with small holes).

*How it works:*
- The mixture is poured into a sieve.
- **Smaller particles** fall through the holes.
- **Larger particles** are left behind on the sieve.

*Indian examples:*
- In every Indian kitchen — flour is sieved through a **chalani** (sieve) to remove bran and lumps before making dough.
- Sand at a construction site is sieved to remove stones.
- In tea-making — a tea strainer acts as a sieve.
- Pebbles are separated from sand on a beach using a wire mesh.

**Principle used:** Difference in **particle size**.

> Try this: Put a mix of semolina (suji) and rice through a fine sieve. The suji falls through but rice stays back.

---

## Method 5 — Sedimentation

When you mix soil or sand with water and leave it undisturbed, the heavy particles **slowly sink to the bottom**. This settling process is called **sedimentation**.

The solid that settles at the bottom is called the **sediment**.

*Examples:*
- Muddy river water left in a pot — sand settles at the bottom.
- After washing vegetables, the soil in the wash water settles.
- In water treatment plants, sedimentation tanks allow mud to settle.

**Principle used:** Heavy (denser) particles **sink** due to gravity.

### Loading (Alum Treatment)

Sedimentation can be **very slow** for fine mud particles. Adding a small amount of **alum (fitkari / फिटकरी)** to muddy water makes the fine particles clump together (coagulate) and settle much faster.

This is used in villages and water treatment plants to purify drinking water.

> **Activity:** Stir some soil in water. Add a small piece of alum and stir. Leave it. Observe how much faster the water becomes clear!

---

## Method 6 — Decantation

After sedimentation, the clear liquid (water) on top can be carefully poured off into another container **without disturbing the sediment at the bottom**. This is called **decantation**.

*Process:*
1. Let the muddy water stand undisturbed until sediment settles.
2. Slowly and carefully tilt the container and pour only the clear liquid on top.
3. The sediment remains behind.

**When used:** After sedimentation. Decantation alone cannot separate the mixture completely — some fine particles may still be in the water.

> Sedimentation and decantation are often done **together** as two steps.

---

## Method 7 — Filtration

Decanted water still has very fine particles in it. **Filtration** is a more thorough method — it passes the liquid through a **filter paper** (or filter material) that has very fine pores.

*How it works:*
1. Fold a filter paper and place it in a funnel.
2. Pour the muddy water (or mixture) slowly.
3. **Water passes through** the tiny pores of the filter paper.
4. **Fine particles (residue)** are too large to pass through and remain on the filter paper.
5. The clear liquid that passes through is called the **filtrate**.

*Examples in real life:*
- **Tea strainer** — separates tea leaves from tea.
- **Water purifier at home** — has filter candles.
- **Kidneys** in our body act as natural filters (cleaning blood).
- **Air filters** in vehicles and air conditioners.
- Filter paper used in laboratories.

**Principle used:** Difference in **particle size** — liquid molecules and dissolved substances pass through; insoluble solid particles do not.

> **Important:** Filtration removes **insoluble** solids. If the solid is dissolved (like salt in water), filtration will NOT remove it. Salt water passed through filter paper remains salty.

## Method 8 — Evaporation

How do we separate a substance that **has dissolved** in water? Filtration will not work. We use **evaporation**.

When a solution is **heated**, the water (solvent) converts into vapour and escapes into the air, leaving the **dissolved solid (solute) behind**.

*Indian examples:*
- **Salt farming** — sea water is collected in flat pans. The sun’s heat evaporates the water, leaving salt crystals behind.
- **Jaggery (gur) making** — sugarcane juice is boiled until the water evaporates, leaving thick jaggery.
- In laboratories — a solution is heated in an evaporating dish until all the water is gone.

**Principle used:** The solvent (water) has a **lower boiling point** than the solute (salt, sugar). Heating turns only the solvent into vapour.

**Limitation:** Only useful when you want to **keep the solid** (salt, sugar) — the solvent (water) is wasted as vapour. If you want to keep both, use a different method.

---

## Method 9 — Condensation (to collect the liquid)

If you want to **collect the evaporated liquid** as well, you can **cool the vapour** to convert it back into liquid. This process is **condensation**.

*Example:*
- Steam from boiling water passes through a cold tube → it condenses into liquid water.
- This is the principle behind **distillation** — purifying liquids by evaporating and then condensing them.
- Getting drinking water from sea water (desalination) uses this method.

---

## Method 10 — Magnetic Separation

**Magnetic separation** uses a **magnet** to separate **magnetic materials** (iron, nickel, cobalt) from non-magnetic ones.

*Examples:*
- Picking iron pins or nails that have fallen into sand using a magnet.
- In factories — magnets on conveyor belts separate iron pieces from scrap.
- In recycling plants — iron and steel are separated from aluminium and plastic.
- Iron ore (iron mixed with sand) is separated using large industrial magnets.

**Principle used:** Only **magnetic materials** are attracted to a magnet. Non-magnetic materials are unaffected.

> **Activity:** Take a mix of sand and iron filings. Pass a magnet over the surface. The iron filings stick to the magnet; the sand stays behind.

## Choosing the Right Method

Different methods are used depending on the **properties of the substances** in the mixture.

| Property difference | Method to use |
| ------------------- | ------------- |
| Particles are large enough to pick | Hand-picking |
| Different sizes of particles | Sieving |
| Different weights (one is lighter) | Winnowing |
| Grain attached to stalks | Threshing |
| Solid heavier than liquid | Sedimentation + Decantation |
| Insoluble solid in liquid | Filtration |
| Solid dissolved in liquid | Evaporation |
| One component is magnetic | Magnetic separation |
