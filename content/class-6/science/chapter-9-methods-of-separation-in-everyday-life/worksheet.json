          "options": [],
          "answer": "Step 1 — Magnetic separation: pass a magnet over the dry mixture to remove iron filings. Step 2 — Sieving or decantation with water: dissolve the remaining salt-sand mixture in water; sand is insoluble and sinks. Step 3 — Filtration: filter the solution through filter paper to remove sand (residue). Step 4 — Evaporation: heat the filtrate (salt solution) to evaporate water, leaving salt behind.",
          "explanation": "Complex mixtures often need multiple methods in sequence. Choosing the right order matters — magnetic separation first (when dry), then use solubility differences (sand vs salt in water), then filter the insoluble, then evaporate the dissolved."

          "options": [],
          "answer": "Threshing separates the grain from the stalks by beating. Winnowing then separates the loose grain from the chaff (husk and broken bits) using wind. Both are needed because threshing gives a mix of grain and chaff, which must then be cleaned by winnowing.",
          "explanation": "After harvesting, the crop goes through threshing first, then winnowing. These two steps together clean the grain for storage and use."

          "options": [],
          "answer": "Hand-picking requires the unwanted pieces to be large enough to see and pick individually. Sand and salt particles are too tiny and numerous to pick by hand. A different method like dissolving in water followed by filtration and evaporation would be needed.",
          "explanation": "Hand-picking works only for coarse mixtures with few unwanted pieces (like stones in rice). For fine particles, faster and more efficient methods are required."

          ],
          "answer": "Sand mixed with pebbles",
          "explanation": "Sieving works when the components have different particle sizes. Sand and pebbles differ in size, so a sieve can separate them. Salt in water is a solution (sieving will not help). Iron and sand need magnetic separation. Grain and chaff need winnowing."

          "answer": "Take a mixture of sand and fine gravel. Place a sieve with holes larger than sand particles but smaller than gravel pieces over a container. Pour the mixture into the sieve. Shake gently. Fine sand particles pass through the holes and collect in the container below. The larger gravel pieces remain in the sieve.",
          "explanation": "Sieving works because the holes in the sieve are larger than sand but smaller than gravel — a physical barrier that separates by size."

Carefully pour the clear water from the top into another container without disturbing the sediment (decantation). The water obtained is clearer but may still have very fine particles.",

          "options": [],
          "answer": "Step 1 — Loading: Add a small piece of alum (fitkari) to the muddy water and stir. Alum causes fine mud particles to coagulate and settle faster. Step 2 — Sedimentation: Leave the water undisturbed for some time. Heavy mud particles and clumped fine particles settle at the bottom. Step 3 — Decantation: Carefully pour the clear water into another clean vessel without disturbing the sediment. Step 4 — Filtration: Pass the decanted water through a filter (filter cloth or filter candle) to remove remaining fine particles. Step 5 — Boiling or other disinfection: Boil the filtered water to kill bacteria and germs. The water is now safe to drink.",

In an alcohol-water mixture, both alcohol and water are liquids that evaporate — just at different temperatures. Simple evaporation would partly evaporate both. A method like distillation (controlled evaporation and condensation) is better for separating two liquids.",

          "question": "In a recycling factory, crushed metal scrap contains a mixture of iron pieces and aluminium pieces. How can they be separated quickly? Explain the principle.",
          "options": [],
          "answer": "A large powerful magnet on a conveyor belt can separate them. When the mixture passes under the magnet, iron pieces (magnetic) are attracted and pulled away. Aluminium pieces (non-magnetic) are not attracted and continue on the belt. This is industrial magnetic separation. The principle: iron is a magnetic material; aluminium is not.",
          "explanation": "Magnetic separation is efficient for large-scale sorting of magnetic from non-magnetic metals. It is widely used in recycling and mining industries."

          "question": "Compare evaporation and condensation. How can both methods be used together to get pure water from salt water?",
          "options": [],
          "answer": "Evaporation is the process where a liquid is heated and converts to vapour. In evaporation alone, the vapour escapes and the dissolved solid (salt) remains. We get salt but lose the water. Condensation is the reverse — water vapour is cooled and converts back to liquid water. When both are combined (distillation): heat the salt water → water evaporates → vapour is led through a cool tube → vapour condenses back into liquid water → this is pure distilled water, free of salt. Salt remains behind. This is how desalination plants get drinking water from sea water in water-scarce regions.",
          "explanation": "Evaporation converts liquid to vapour; condensation converts vapour back to liquid. Together they allow us to separate and collect both components — pure water and the dissolved salt — without wasting either."
