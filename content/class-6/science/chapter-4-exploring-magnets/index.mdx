title: Chapter 4 Exploring Magnets

## Have You Ever Played with a Magnet?

A **magnet** is an object that can attract certain materials, especially iron, nickel, and cobalt. Magnets are found in many everyday devices — from refrigerator door seals to electric motors and computer hard drives.

The word “magnet” comes from **Magnesia**, a region in ancient Greece where rocks that attracted iron were found. These natural rocks are called **lodestones** (also written as loadstones).

## Types of Magnets

Magnets come in different shapes and sizes:

| Shape | Name |
|-------|------|
| Bar-shaped | Bar Magnet |
| U-shaped or horseshoe | Horseshoe Magnet |
| Round flat disc | Disc Magnet |
| Thin strip | Strip Magnet |
| Cylindrical rod | Rod Magnet |

**Natural magnets** are found in nature (e.g., lodestone).
**Artificial magnets** are made by humans from iron and other materials.

## Poles of a Magnet

Every magnet has **two poles**:

- **North Pole (N)** — the end that points toward the geographic north when the magnet is free to swing.
- **South Pole (S)** — the end that points toward the geographic south.

### The Rule of Poles

> **Like poles repel each other; unlike poles attract each other.**

- N + N → **Repel** (push away)
- S + S → **Repel** (push away)
- N + S → **Attract** (pull toward)

You can feel this force if you bring two bar magnets near each other. When the same poles face each other, you can feel them pushing apart even before they touch!

## Magnetic and Non-Magnetic Materials

Not all materials are attracted to a magnet. Materials that are attracted to a magnet are called **magnetic materials**. Materials that are not attracted are called **non-magnetic materials**.

### Magnetic Materials (examples)
- Iron nails
- Steel pins
- Nickel coins
- Cobalt pieces

### Non-Magnetic Materials (examples)
- Wood
- Plastic
- Glass
- Paper
- Rubber
- Copper
- Aluminium
- Cloth

> **Try it!** Hold a bar magnet close to a pile of mixed objects — iron pins, paper clips, rubber bands, and bits of paper. Which ones jump to the magnet? Those are magnetic materials.

## Magnetic Field

The area around a magnet where its force acts is called the **magnetic field**.

- The magnetic field is **strongest near the poles**.
- It becomes **weaker as you move away** from the magnet.
- We can represent a magnetic field using **field lines** — imaginary curved lines that show the direction in which the north pole of a small test magnet would point.

### Drawing Field Lines with Iron Filings

If you place a sheet of paper over a bar magnet and sprinkle iron filings on it, then tap the paper gently, the iron filings arrange themselves into a pattern of curved lines from one pole to the other. This pattern shows the magnetic field.

## The Compass — A Magnet That Shows Direction

A **compass** is a small instrument containing a freely rotating magnetic needle.

- The needle always aligns itself along the **north–south direction**.
- The end pointing north is called the **north-seeking pole** of the needle.
- Sailors, trekkers, and geographers use compasses to find directions.

### Why Does a Compass Work?

The Earth itself behaves like a huge magnet. The geographic **North Pole** of Earth is near the magnetic south pole of Earth’s internal magnet. This is why the north pole of a compass needle is attracted toward the geographic north.

> **Activity:** Tie a bar magnet in the middle with a thread so it hangs freely (a “freely suspended magnet”). Notice how it always settles pointing in the same direction — north to south. This is the principle behind a compass.

## Making a Magnet (Magnetisation)

You can **magnetise** a piece of iron or steel to make an artificial magnet.

### Rubbing Method
- Stroke one pole of a magnet over the iron piece repeatedly in **one direction only**.
- After many strokes, the iron piece becomes a magnet.

### Using Electricity (Electromagnet)
- When electric current flows through a coil of wire wrapped around an iron rod, the rod becomes a magnet.
- This is called an **electromagnet**.
- Electromagnets can be **switched on and off** — used in cranes to lift heavy iron objects.

---

## Losing Magnetism (Demagnetisation)

A magnet can lose its magnetic properties if it is:

- **Dropped** repeatedly from a height
- **Heated** to high temperatures
- **Hammered** hard

This is because the tiny internal magnets (called **domains**) get disturbed and lose their alignment.

## Uses of Magnets

Magnets are extremely useful in daily life and technology:

| Where | How Magnets Are Used |
|-------|----------------------|
| Refrigerator door | Strip magnets keep the door sealed |
| Compass | Magnetic needle shows direction |
| Electric bell | Electromagnet attracts iron strip to ring bell |
| Loudspeaker | Magnet converts electric signal to sound |
| Credit/Debit card | Magnetic strip stores data |
| Toys | Small magnets create movement in toys |
| MRI machine | Strong magnets scan the human body |
| Crane | Electromagnets lift heavy iron/steel loads |
| Computer hard disk | Data stored using magnetic fields |

## Storytime — The Discovery of Magnets

According to an ancient Greek legend, a shepherd named **Magnes** was walking on a hillside in Magnesia (a region of Greece) when the iron tip of his walking stick and the iron nails in his sandals were suddenly stuck to a rock. That rock was a lodestone — a natural magnet! This story, whether true or not, explains why we call this fascinating object a *magnet*.
