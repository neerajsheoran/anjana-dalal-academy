          "options": [],
          "answer": "The Earth behaves like a giant magnet. The Earth’s magnetic south pole is near the geographic north pole, which attracts the north pole of the suspended magnet. This is why the magnet’s north-seeking pole always points geographically north.",
          "explanation": "Earth’s magnetic field aligns any freely suspended magnet along the geographic north-south direction."

          "question": "Can a magnet be made to lose its magnetism? How?",
          "options": [],
          "answer": "Yes, a magnet can lose its magnetism (demagnetisation) by: (1) dropping it repeatedly from a height, (2) heating it to a high temperature, (3) hammering it hard. These actions disturb the alignment of magnetic domains inside the magnet.",
          "explanation": "Magnetic domains are tiny regions inside a magnet where atoms are aligned. Any shock or heat disrupts this alignment, causing loss of magnetism."

          "options": [],
          "answer": "Place a sheet of paper over a bar magnet and sprinkle iron filings on it. Tap the paper gently. The iron filings arrange into curved lines going from the north pole to the south pole. These lines represent the magnetic field lines.",
          "explanation": "Iron filings act like tiny compass needles and align along the magnetic field lines, revealing the field pattern around the magnet."

          "options": [],
          "answer": "1. Compass — magnetic needle points north-south to show direction. 2. Refrigerator door seal — strip magnet keeps the door closed airtight. 3. Crane — electromagnet lifts and moves heavy iron/steel loads in factories. 4. Credit card — magnetic strip on the card stores account information.",
          "explanation": "Magnets are used wherever attraction, direction-finding, data storage, or controllable lifting force is needed."
