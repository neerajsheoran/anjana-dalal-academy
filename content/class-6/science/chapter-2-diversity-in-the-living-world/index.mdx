## Diversity in Plants and Animals Around Us

Have you ever gone for a walk in a park or a garden and noticed how many different kinds of plants and animals are around you? Tall trees, tiny shrubs, colourful flowers, ants on the ground, butterflies in the air, birds on the branches — all living together in the same place.

This amazing variety of living things — all the different plants, animals, insects, birds, and tiny organisms found on Earth — is called **biodiversity**.

> **Key idea:** Biodiversity means the variety of all living things found on Earth. It makes our planet rich, beautiful, and healthy.

India is one of the most biodiverse countries in the world. We have dense forests in the Western Ghats, cold deserts in Ladakh, tropical rainforests in the Northeast, and mangrove swamps in the Sundarbans — each home to different kinds of living things.

Imagine two children — Mia and Boojho — going on a nature walk in their school garden. In just one hour they find:

- 3 types of trees (mango, neem, gulmohar)
- 2 types of shrubs (hibiscus, rose)
- Tiny herb plants (grass, mint, tulsi)
- Creepers (money plant, bougainvillea)
- Ants, butterflies, a sparrow, and a squirrel

So much life in one small garden! Now imagine the variety across all of India — and the entire Earth.

## How Do We Group Plants?

With so many plants around us, scientists group them to study them better. We can group plants in many ways — by their size, the shape of their leaves, their roots, or their seeds.

### By Size and Structure

**Herbs**
- Small, soft-stemmed plants
- Usually short (less than 1 metre tall)
- Examples: tulsi, mint, coriander, wheat, grass

**Shrubs**
- Medium-sized plants with hard woody stems
- Many branches starting from near the base
- Examples: rose, hibiscus, mehendi (henna), lemon plant

**Trees**
- Tall plants with one thick, hard woody trunk
- Branches start high up
- Examples: mango, neem, banyan, teak, coconut

**Climbers**
- Plants with weak, thin stems that cannot stand on their own
- They **climb** by wrapping around or clinging to walls, fences, or other plants
- Examples: money plant, bougainvillea, pea plant, grapevine

**Creepers**
- Plants with weak stems that **creep along the ground**
- Examples: watermelon, pumpkin, strawberry

> **Remember:** Climbers go up. Creepers spread along the ground.

### By Leaf Venation

Look at a leaf carefully. You will see thin lines running through it — these are called **veins**. The pattern of veins in a leaf is called **venation**.

There are two types:

**Parallel venation** — All the veins run side by side, parallel to each other (like lines on a ruled page)
- Examples: grass, banana, sugarcane, wheat, maize

**Reticulate (net-like) venation** — The veins form a network, like a net
- Examples: mango, rose, tulsi, hibiscus, neem

---

### By Root Type

Every plant has roots underground that absorb water and nutrients from the soil. There are two main types:

**Taproot**
- One main thick root going deep into the soil
- Many smaller roots branching off the main root
- Examples: carrot, radish, mustard, mango, neem

> The carrot and radish that we eat — they ARE the taproot!

**Fibrous root**
- Many thin roots of almost the same size, spreading in all directions like a bunch of fibres
- No single main root
- Examples: wheat, rice, onion, grass, maize

---

### By Seeds (Dicot and Monocot)

When you open a seed, you can see the tiny structures inside. The thick leaf-like parts inside a seed are called **cotyledons** (seed leaves).

**Monocot** (one cotyledon)
- Seeds that split into **one part**
- Examples: maize, wheat, rice, grass

**Dicot** (two cotyledons)
- Seeds that split into **two parts**
- Examples: bean, pea, mango, mustard, neem

> **Try this at home:** Soak a gram (chana) seed overnight and open it the next morning. You will clearly see it split into two — that's a dicot!

## How Do We Group Animals?

Just as we group plants, we can also group animals — by how they move, what body parts they have, and where they live.

### By How They Move

| Movement | Examples |
|----------|---------|
| Walk / Run | Dog, cat, elephant, ant, lizard |
| Fly | Sparrow, eagle, butterfly, mosquito |
| Swim | Fish, frog, whale, duck |
| Slither (crawl on belly) | Snake, earthworm |
| Jump | Frog, grasshopper, kangaroo |

Some animals can do more than one — a duck can walk, swim, AND fly!

### By Body Parts

Another way scientists group animals is by their body structure:

**Animals with a backbone (Vertebrates)**
- Fish, frogs, snakes, birds, cats, humans
- They have a spine running down their back

**Animals without a backbone (Invertebrates)**
- Insects, spiders, worms, snails, jellyfish
- No spine

> Over 95% of all animal species on Earth are invertebrates — most of them are insects!

## Habitats and Adaptations

Every living thing needs food, water, air, and shelter to survive. The natural place where a plant or animal lives is called its **habitat**.

Different habitats have very different conditions — some are hot and dry, some are cold and icy, some are underwater. Over thousands of years, plants and animals have developed special features that help them survive in their habitat. These special features are called **adaptations**.

### Terrestrial Habitats (Land)

**Desert**
- Very hot and dry — very little water
- Plants: Cactus — thick fleshy stems to store water; leaves modified into spines to prevent water loss
- Animals: Camel — stores fat in its hump; can go many days without water; wide, flat feet to walk on sand

**Mountain / Cold regions**
- Very cold, windy, heavy snowfall
- Animals: Snow leopard — thick fur coat to stay warm; large padded paws to walk on snow
- Trees: Pine and fir trees — needle-shaped leaves so snow slides off easily

**Forests**
- Warm, moist, lots of rainfall
- Animals: Monkey — long arms and gripping hands for climbing trees
- Plants: Huge variety of trees, ferns, mosses, orchids

### Aquatic Habitats (Water)

**Rivers and Ponds (Freshwater)**
- Plants: Lotus — long flexible stalks to reach the surface; waxy leaves to repel water
- Animals: Fish — streamlined body to swim through water; gills to breathe in water

**Ocean (Saltwater)**
- Animals: Dolphins — can hold breath for long time; smooth streamlined body
- Whales — largest animals on Earth, live entirely in water

> **Key idea:** An animal or plant that lives in one habitat is usually NOT suited to another. A camel would struggle in an ocean; a fish cannot survive in a desert.

## Why Biodiversity Matters

Biodiversity is not just beautiful — it is essential for life on Earth.

- **Forests** clean the air we breathe and give us rain
- **Bees and butterflies** pollinate crops — without them, fruits and vegetables cannot grow
- **Worms and fungi** break down dead material and enrich the soil
- **Mangrove forests** protect coastlines from floods and storms

When we cut forests, pollute water, or hunt animals, we destroy this balance. Many species are already **endangered** (at risk of disappearing) or **extinct** (gone forever).

Protecting biodiversity means protecting our own future.

> **Remember:** Every plant and animal — even the ones we find ordinary — plays an important role in the web of life.
