# Food: Where Does It Come From?

## What is Food?

Everything you eat is food. Dal, rice, roti, vegetables, milk, eggs — all of this is food.

But have you ever thought — **where does all this food actually come from?**

## Two Big Sources of Food

All our food comes from just **two places**:

1. **Plants**
2. **Animals**

That's it. Everything on your plate comes from either a plant or an animal.

## Food from Plants

Most of what we eat comes from plants. Let's look at which part of the plant we eat:

| Part of Plant | Examples |
|---|---|
| **Roots** | Carrot, radish (mooli), beetroot |
| **Stem** | Potato, sugarcane, ginger |
| **Leaves** | Spinach (palak), cabbage, methi |
| **Flower** | Cauliflower (gobi), banana flower |
| **Fruit** | Mango, apple, tomato, brinjal |
| **Seeds** | Wheat, rice, dal, mustard |

> **Real life example:** When your mom makes aloo sabzi, the potato is the **stem** of the plant stored underground. When she makes palak paneer, spinach is the **leaf** of the plant.

## Food from Animals

Some food comes from animals. These animals are called **sources of food**.

- **Milk** → comes from cows, buffaloes, goats
- **Eggs** → come from hens (and sometimes ducks)
- **Honey** → made by bees
- **Meat and fish** → from various animals

> **Real life example:** The milk in your morning chai comes from a cow or buffalo. The curd (dahi) your mom makes is also from that same milk.

## What Do Animals Eat?

Interesting question! Not all animals eat the same things.

### Animals that eat only plants — called **Herbivores**
- Cow, goat, rabbit, deer
- They eat grass, leaves, fruits

### Animals that eat only other animals — called **Carnivores**
- Lion, tiger, snake
- They hunt and eat other animals

### Animals that eat both plants and animals — called **Omnivores**
- Humans, dogs, bears, crows
- We eat both dal-roti (plants) and chicken/eggs (animals)

> **Think about it:** You are an omnivore! You eat both plants (rice, vegetables) and animal products (milk, eggs).

## Ingredients — What Goes Into Our Food?

When your mom cooks, she uses many ingredients together. Each ingredient comes from a plant or animal.

**Example — Dal Tadka:**
- Dal (lentils) → **seeds of a plant**
- Onion → **bulb of a plant**
- Tomato → **fruit of a plant**
- Ghee → **from cow's milk (animal)**
- Jeera (cumin) → **seeds of a plant**
- Haldi (turmeric) → **root of a plant**

Every single ingredient has a source!

## Quick Summary

- All food comes from **plants** or **animals**
- We eat different parts of plants — roots, stems, leaves, flowers, fruits, seeds
- Animals give us milk, eggs, honey, and meat
- Animals that eat only plants → **Herbivores**
- Animals that eat only animals → **Carnivores**
- Animals that eat both → **Omnivores**
- Humans are **omnivores**
