title: Chapter 5 Measurement of Length and Motion

## Why Do We Measure?

Imagine telling a friend: “My school is *far* from my house.” Or: “This rope is *long*.” These descriptions are vague — what is “far” or “long”? To communicate clearly in science and everyday life, we need **measurement** — finding the exact size, length, or quantity of something using a standard unit.

## Standard Units of Measurement

Early people used body parts — a hand span, a foot length, or an arm’s length (cubit) — to measure things. But these vary from person to person! To avoid confusion, scientists worldwide agreed on a common system of units called the **International System of Units (SI units)**.

### SI Unit of Length

The SI unit of length is the **metre (m)**.

Other units used for length:

| Unit | Symbol | Relation to metre |
|------|--------|-------------------|
| Kilometre | km | 1 km = 1000 m |
| Metre | m | 1 m = 100 cm |
| Centimetre | cm | 1 cm = 10 mm |
| Millimetre | mm | Smallest common unit |

> **Real-life example:** Your height is measured in cm or m. The distance between two cities is measured in km. The thickness of a coin is measured in mm.

## Measuring Length with a Ruler

A **ruler** (or scale) is marked with centimetres (cm) and millimetres (mm). To measure length correctly:

1. Place the object along the ruler.
2. Align one end with the **zero mark** (not the edge of the ruler).
3. Read the marking at the other end — **read at eye level** to avoid error.

### Errors to Avoid

- **Parallax error** — reading the scale at an angle instead of straight on.
- **Not starting at zero** — starting from the edge of the ruler instead of the 0 cm mark.

## Measuring Curved Lines

A straight ruler cannot measure a curved line directly. We can use:

- A **thread** — lay it along the curve, mark the end, then measure the thread against a ruler.
- A **divider (or map measurer)** — a compass-like tool used to measure curves on maps.

> **Activity:** Use a thread to measure the circumference (outer edge) of a coin or a round bottle cap. Compare results with classmates.

## Motion

**Motion** means a change in the position of an object over time.

- A ball rolling across the ground is in **motion**.
- A book lying still on a table is **at rest**.

An object can appear to be in motion from one person’s point of view and at rest from another’s. This is called **relative motion**.

> **Example:** A passenger sitting inside a moving train is at rest relative to other passengers in the same train, but in motion relative to a person standing on the platform.

## Types of Motion

### 1. Linear (Straight-line) Motion
The object moves in a **straight line**.
- Examples: A car moving on a straight road, a ball dropped from height, a stone thrown horizontally.

### 2. Circular Motion
The object moves along a **circular path**.
- Examples: A stone tied to a string and swung, the blades of a fan, the Earth revolving around the Sun, hands of a clock.

### 3. Oscillatory (To-and-Fro) Motion
The object moves **back and forth** about a fixed position repeatedly.
- Examples: A pendulum of a clock, a child on a swing, the strings of a guitar when plucked.

### 4. Periodic Motion
Any motion that **repeats at regular intervals** is called periodic motion.
- Examples: Oscillatory motions are periodic. The motion of the Earth around the Sun is also periodic (one year = one period).

## Speed — How Fast Is Something Moving?

**Speed** tells us how quickly an object covers distance.

**Formula:**
> Speed = Distance ÷ Time

| Unit | Symbol |
|------|--------|
| metre per second | m/s |
| kilometre per hour | km/h |

> **Example:** If a cyclist covers 30 km in 1 hour, the speed = 30 ÷ 1 = **30 km/h**.

### Uniform and Non-Uniform Motion

- **Uniform motion** — the object covers equal distances in equal intervals of time. (e.g., a train on a straight track at constant speed)
- **Non-uniform motion** — the object covers unequal distances in equal intervals. (e.g., a car in city traffic)

---

## Measuring Time

**Time** is measured in seconds (s), minutes (min), and hours (h).

- 60 seconds = 1 minute
- 60 minutes = 1 hour

In science experiments, we use a **stopwatch** to measure short time intervals precisely.

A **simple pendulum** also keeps time — one complete to-and-fro swing is called its **time period**.

---

## Distance–Time Graph

A **distance–time graph** shows how an object’s distance from a starting point changes over time.

- A **straight sloping line** = uniform motion (constant speed)
- A **horizontal line** = the object is at rest
- A **curved line** = non-uniform motion (changing speed)
