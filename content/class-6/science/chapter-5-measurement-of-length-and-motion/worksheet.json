          "options": [],
          "answer": "Because body parts vary from person to person, making measurements inconsistent. Standard units were needed so measurements could be compared and understood universally.",
          "explanation": "A hand span of one person may be different from another’s. Standard units ensure everyone gets the same measurement for the same object."

          "options": [],
          "answer": "Relative motion means that whether an object appears to be in motion or at rest depends on the observer’s position. Example: A passenger sitting in a moving train is at rest relative to other passengers in the same train, but appears to be in motion to a person standing on the platform.",
          "explanation": "Motion is always relative to a reference point. The same object can be in motion and at rest depending on who is observing it."
