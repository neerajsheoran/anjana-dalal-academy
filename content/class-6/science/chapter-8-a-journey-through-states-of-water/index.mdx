## The Puzzle of Ice and Water

> *“If it does not rain well, even the mighty ocean will be drained.”*
> — Thirukkural

Aavi and Thirav were making shikanji (lemonade). Thirav dropped ice cubes into his glass. As they waited, the ice melted. Aavi asked: “Is the ice the same as water? They look different but both are water!” That question takes us on a fascinating journey through the **states of water**.

Water is the only substance we encounter daily in all three states — **solid (ice)**, **liquid (water)**, and **gas (water vapour)** — and it can change between them with just heating or cooling.

## Evaporation — Water’s Disappearing Act

Have you noticed:
- Wet clothes dry out after a few hours?
- A mopped floor becomes dry?
- Puddles disappear after a sunny day?
- Sweat on your skin disappears?

In all these cases, **liquid water is converting into water vapour** — an invisible gas that mixes with the air. This process is called **evaporation**.

> **Evaporation** is the process by which a liquid converts into vapour (gas) at its surface, below its boiling point.

### Factors That Speed Up or Slow Down Evaporation
| Factor | Effect on Evaporation |
|--------|----------------------|
| **Temperature** | Higher temperature → faster evaporation |
| **Surface area** | Larger exposed area → faster evaporation |
| **Air movement (wind)** | More wind → faster evaporation |
| **Humidity** | More moisture in air → slower evaporation |

> **Activity:** Spread the same amount of water on a large plate and in a small bowl. Which dries faster? The plate — because it has a larger surface area exposed to air.

## Condensation — Water Appearing from Nowhere

Take a glass tumbler and fill it with cold water or ice. After a few minutes you will notice **water droplets forming on the outer surface** of the glass — even though no water was poured on the outside!

This water comes from the **air around the glass**. Air contains invisible water vapour. When this water vapour touches the cold glass surface, it loses heat and converts back into liquid water. This process is called **condensation**.

> **Condensation** is the process by which water vapour (gas) converts into liquid water when it cools down.

### Where Do We See Condensation?
- **Dew drops** on grass and leaves early in the morning — the cold surfaces cause water vapour in air to condense overnight
- **Fog and mist** — tiny droplets of water suspended in air
- **Breath on a cold day** — you can see a little cloud when you breathe out in winter
- **Mirror fogging up** after a hot shower

### Humidity

The amount of water vapour present in the air is called **humidity**.

- On a **humid day**, the air already has a lot of water vapour — sweat evaporates slowly, making us feel hot and sticky.
- On a **dry day**, the air has little water vapour — sweat evaporates quickly, cooling us efficiently.

## The Three States of Water

| State | Example | Shape | Volume | Movement |
|-------|---------|-------|--------|----------|
| **Solid** | Ice, snow, hail | Fixed shape | Fixed | Particles vibrate in place |
| **Liquid** | Water, rain | No fixed shape — takes shape of container | Fixed | Particles flow past each other |
| **Gas** | Water vapour, steam | No fixed shape | No fixed volume — fills entire space | Particles move freely and fast |

## Changing States of Water

Water changes state when **heat is added or removed**.

### Melting — Solid to Liquid
When ice (solid) is **heated**, it melts into liquid water.
- **Melting point of ice:** 0°C

### Freezing — Liquid to Solid
When water (liquid) is **cooled**, it freezes into ice.
- **Freezing point of water:** 0°C (same as melting point)

### Evaporation — Liquid to Gas
When water is **heated**, it evaporates into water vapour.
- Water boils at **100°C** (boiling point), but evaporation also happens slowly at lower temperatures (e.g., clothes drying at room temperature).

### Condensation — Gas to Liquid
When water vapour is **cooled**, it condenses into liquid water.

## The Cooling Effect of Evaporation

When a liquid **evaporates**, it takes heat from its surroundings. This causes **cooling**.

### Examples of Cooling by Evaporation

**1. Earthen pot (matka/surahi)**
Water slowly seeps through the tiny pores of an earthen pot and evaporates from the outer surface. This takes heat away from the water inside, keeping it cool — even without a refrigerator!

**2. Sweating**
Our body produces sweat (a liquid). When sweat **evaporates** from the skin, it takes away body heat — cooling us down. Sitting under a fan speeds up evaporation of sweat, making us feel cooler.

**3. Sprinkling water**
In summer, sprinkling water on a roof or floor causes it to evaporate, taking heat away and cooling the surface.

**4. Pot-in-pot cooler**
A traditional desert cooler — one pot placed inside another, with wet sand between them. Water in the sand evaporates, cooling the inner pot and the food inside it.

> **Notice:** After you step out of a swimming pool or bath, you feel cold. This is because water on your skin evaporates and takes heat away. That’s cooling by evaporation!

## How Do Clouds Form and Give Us Rain?

### Step by Step: The Water Cycle

1. **Evaporation** — Heat from the Sun causes water from oceans, rivers, and lakes to evaporate into water vapour. Water vapour is lighter than air, so it rises.

2. **Condensation** — As water vapour rises, it cools. When it cools enough, it condenses around tiny dust particles in the atmosphere, forming tiny water droplets. Millions of these droplets together form a **cloud**.

3. **Precipitation** — The tiny droplets join together and grow bigger. When they become heavy enough, they fall as **rain**. In very cold conditions, water vapour freezes directly into ice crystals, falling as **snow** or **hail**.

4. **Collection** — Rainwater collects in rivers, lakes, and oceans. Some soaks into the ground (groundwater). And the cycle repeats!

> This continuous journey of water — from oceans to clouds to rain and back — is called the **Water Cycle** (also called the **hydrological cycle**).

### AWG — Collecting Water from Air

**Atmospheric Water Generators (AWGs)** are machines that pull water vapour from the air and condense it into drinkable water. They are used in places with scarce water but high humidity, showing how condensation can be a practical source of fresh water.
