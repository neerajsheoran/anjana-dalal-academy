## What is Science?

Have you ever wondered — why does the sky look blue? Why does a raw mango taste sour but a ripe one tastes sweet? Why does ice melt when you hold it in your hand?

These questions pop up in every curious mind. **Science is the way we try to find answers to these questions.**

Science is not just a school subject. It is a way of **thinking**, **observing**, and **doing things** to understand the world around us.

> **Key idea:** Science starts with curiosity. When you look at something carefully and ask "why?" or "how?" — that is the beginning of science.

The word "science" comes from the Latin word *scientia*, which means **knowledge**. But science is not just about collecting facts. It is about discovering new things and understanding how and why things happen.

## What Will We Explore in This Book?

This book — *Curiosity* — will take you on an exciting journey through the natural world. Here is a quick look at what we will discover together:

- **Living things** — Why are there so many different kinds of plants and animals? How are they different from non-living things?
- **Food and health** — What nutrients does our body need? What happens when we don't eat the right food?
- **Materials around us** — Why is glass used for windows but not for pots? Why does metal feel colder than wood even at the same temperature?
- **Water** — How does rain form? Why does a wet shirt dry in the sun?
- **Temperature** — How do we measure hot and cold? Why does a doctor check your temperature when you are sick?
- **Magnets** — Why does a compass always point north? How do magnets work?
- **Motion and measurement** — How do we measure distances accurately? What are different types of motion?
- **The universe** — What are stars made of? How far away is the Moon?

All of these topics will help you see science in your everyday life — in your kitchen, in your garden, in the sky above you.

## How Do We Find Answers? — The Scientific Method

When scientists have a question, they don't just guess the answer. They follow a step-by-step process to find the correct answer. This process is called the **scientific method**.

Let's understand each step with a simple Indian example.

**Imagine this situation:** Your mother plants a tulsi (basil) plant near the window. After a few days, she notices the plant is leaning towards the window. She wonders — *why is the plant bending towards the window?*

### Step 1 — Observe

Look carefully at what is happening. Use your eyes, ears, nose, or instruments to gather information.

*Example: You observe that the tulsi plant is bending towards the side where the window is.*

### Step 2 — Ask a Question

Turn your observation into a clear question.

*Example: "Does the plant bend towards the window because of sunlight?"*

### Step 3 — Make a Guess (Hypothesis)

A **hypothesis** is an educated guess — a possible answer to your question based on what you already know.

*Example: "I think the plant bends towards sunlight because it needs light to make food."*

> A hypothesis is not a random guess. It is based on what you already know or have observed.

### Step 4 — Do an Experiment (Test)

Design a simple test to check whether your hypothesis is correct or not. Change only **one thing** at a time to keep the test fair.

*Example: Place one tulsi plant near the window (with sunlight) and another tulsi plant in a dark corner (without sunlight). Keep everything else — soil, water, pot size — the same. Observe both plants after a week.*

### Step 5 — Analyse Results

Look at what happened in the experiment. Did your guess turn out to be correct?

*Example: The plant near the window grew towards the light. The plant in the dark corner grew weak and pale. This supports the hypothesis.*

### Step 6 — Draw a Conclusion

Based on your results, write down what you found out.

*Example: "Plants bend towards sunlight because they need light to grow and make food."*

Here is the complete process at a glance:

| Step | What you do |
|------|-------------|
| 1. Observe | Look carefully at something |
| 2. Ask a Question | What do you want to find out? |
| 3. Hypothesis | Make an educated guess |
| 4. Experiment | Test your guess fairly |
| 5. Analyse | Study the results |
| 6. Conclusion | What did you find out? |

## Science is All Around Us

You do not need a laboratory to think like a scientist. People around you use scientific thinking every day without even realising it.

**The cook in your home** — Your mother (or whoever cooks at home) knows that dal takes longer to cook than rice. She knows that adding a pinch of hing (asafoetida) reduces gas problems. She has learned this through observation and experience — that is science!

**The bicycle repair person** — When your cycle tyre goes flat, the repair person puts the tube in water to find the hole. They look for air bubbles coming out — that is observation and problem solving — just like science.

**The farmer** — A farmer in Punjab checks the soil, looks at the weather, and decides when to sow wheat. They have learned through years of observation what works and what doesn't — that is scientific thinking.

**The doctor** — When you visit a doctor with fever, they ask questions, examine you, and then decide the cause. They follow the same steps as a scientist — observe, question, test, conclude.

> **Remember:** Science is not just for scientists in labs. It is a way of thinking that everyone can use to solve problems in daily life.

## Science is a Team Activity

One important thing about science — **scientists rarely work alone.**

Big discoveries happen when scientists from different parts of the world share their findings, check each other's work, and build on each other's ideas.

Think of it like a cricket team. A batsman cannot win a match alone — the team wins together. In the same way, the discovery of vaccines, satellites, or medicines was not done by one person. Hundreds of scientists from many countries worked together over many years.

When a scientist makes a discovery, they share it with other scientists who then **repeat the experiment** to check if the results are the same. This is called **peer review** and it makes science trustworthy.

> **Key idea:** Science grows when people share knowledge, question each other's ideas respectfully, and work together.
