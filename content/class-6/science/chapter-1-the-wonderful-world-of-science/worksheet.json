          "answer": "Why does a mango taste sour when raw?",

          "question": "Science is described as a 'way of thinking' rather than just a collection of facts. What do you think this means? Explain with an example.",
          "answer": "It means science is about the process of questioning, observing and testing — not just memorising answers. Example: Instead of just memorising that plants need sunlight, a scientist would ask 'what happens to a plant kept in the dark?' and actually test it to find out.",
          "explanation": "Facts can change as we discover new things, but the scientific way of thinking — observe, question, test, conclude — remains the foundation of all discovery."

          "answer": "Only one thing at a time",

          "answer": "Hypothesis: The tulsi plant leans towards the window because it is growing towards sunlight. This can be tested by placing one plant near a window and another in a dark corner and observing which direction each plant grows.",
          "explanation": "A good hypothesis is specific and testable. It says what you think is happening and gives a way to check if you are right."

          "answer": "No, it is not a fair experiment. He changed two things — the fertiliser AND the amount of water. If one plant grows better, we won't know if it was because of the fertiliser or because of the water. To fix it, he should keep the water amount exactly the same in both pots and only change whether fertiliser is added or not.",
          "explanation": "A fair test (controlled experiment) only changes one variable at a time. All other conditions must be kept the same so the results can be trusted."

          "answer": "Conclusions must be based on actual results from experiments, not on guesses. If we conclude before experimenting, we might be wrong and mislead others. For example, someone might wrongly conclude that 'eating neem leaves cures all diseases' without any testing — which could be dangerous.",
          "explanation": "Conclusions are only reliable when backed by evidence from experiments. This is why science is trustworthy — it doesn't accept claims without proof."

          "answer": "1. Observe: Turmeric is used traditionally on cuts and wounds. 2. Question: Does turmeric actually help wounds heal faster? 3. Hypothesis: Turmeric has antibacterial properties that may help wounds heal faster. 4. Experiment: Apply turmeric on cuts for one group (Group A) and no turmeric for another group (Group B). Keep all other conditions the same — wound size, cleaning, bandaging. 5. Analyse: Measure healing time for both groups over several days. 6. Conclusion: If Group A heals faster consistently, the hypothesis is supported. If there is no difference, the hypothesis is rejected.",
          "explanation": "This is actually a real scientific question! Turmeric contains curcumin which does have antibacterial properties. Traditional knowledge and science can work together — but the claim must be tested properly before it is accepted."

No single person can know everything or do everything alone. Different scientists bring different skills and knowledge.",

          "answer": "We should not immediately believe it because one person's result could have errors, biases, or could be a coincidence. Before accepting it: 1. Other scientists should repeat the same experiment independently. 2. The results should be peer reviewed by experts. 3. It should be tested on more people (clinical trials). 4. Results should be published for the entire science community to examine. Only after all this can the claim be trusted.",
          "explanation": "Science protects us from false claims by requiring evidence that is repeatable and verified by many people. This is why we trust scientific findings more than one person's claim."
