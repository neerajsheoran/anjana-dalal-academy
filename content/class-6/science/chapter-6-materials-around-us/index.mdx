title: Chapter 6 Materials Around Us
---

## Look Around You!

Everything around us — the chair you sit on, the glass you drink from, the clothes you wear, the food you eat — is made of some **material**. Materials are substances from which objects are made.

Different materials have different **properties** (characteristics), which make them suitable for specific uses. Understanding materials and their properties helps us choose the right material for the right job.

## Grouping Materials

We can sort materials into groups based on where they come from:

### 1. Natural Materials
Materials found in nature without human processing.
- **From plants:** Wood, cotton, jute, rubber, paper
- **From animals:** Wool, silk, leather, honey
- **From the Earth:** Stone, sand, clay, metals (iron, copper, gold), coal, petroleum

### 2. Synthetic (Man-made) Materials
Materials made by humans using chemical processes.
- Plastic, nylon, polyester, glass, cement, steel, medicines

## Properties of Materials

The **properties** of a material determine how it behaves and what it can be used for.

### 1. Hardness
- **Hard** materials resist scratching and change in shape.
- Examples: Steel, diamond, stone, glass
- **Soft** materials are easily scratched or shaped.
- Examples: Cotton, rubber, clay

### 2. Texture
- **Smooth** materials feel even (e.g., glass, polished stone).
- **Rough** materials feel uneven or grainy (e.g., sandpaper, brick).

### 3. Lustre (Shininess)
- **Lustrous** materials appear shiny — mostly metals.
- Examples: Gold, silver, copper, iron (when polished)
- **Non-lustrous** materials appear dull.
- Examples: Wood, chalk, rubber

### 4. Transparency
- **Transparent** materials allow light to pass through clearly.
- Examples: Glass, clear plastic, water
- **Translucent** materials allow some light through but scatter it.
- Examples: Frosted glass, tissue paper, butter paper
- **Opaque** materials do not allow any light through.
- Examples: Wood, metal, stone, cardboard

### 5. Solubility in Water
- **Soluble** materials dissolve in water.
- Examples: Salt, sugar, vinegar
- **Insoluble** materials do not dissolve in water.
- Examples: Sand, chalk powder, sawdust

> **Activity:** Add a spoonful each of salt, sand, and chalk powder to separate glasses of water. Stir. Which ones dissolve? Sugar and salt are soluble; sand and chalk are insoluble.

### 6. Conductivity
- **Conductors** allow heat or electricity to flow through them.
- Examples: All metals (copper, iron, aluminium)
- **Insulators** do not allow heat or electricity to flow easily.
- Examples: Wood, plastic, rubber, glass, cloth

### 7. Flexibility
- **Flexible** materials can be bent or twisted without breaking.
- Examples: Rubber, cloth, thin metal wire
- **Rigid (stiff)** materials cannot be bent easily.
- Examples: Stone, glass, thick iron rod

### 8. Magnetic Property
- **Magnetic** materials are attracted to magnets.
- Examples: Iron, nickel, cobalt
- **Non-magnetic** materials are not attracted to magnets.
- Examples: Copper, aluminium, wood, plastic

## States of Matter

All materials exist in one of three **states of matter**:

| State | Shape | Volume | Examples |
|-------|-------|--------|---------|
| Solid | Fixed | Fixed | Stone, ice, wood, iron |
| Liquid | No fixed shape (takes container shape) | Fixed | Water, milk, oil |
| Gas | No fixed shape or volume | No fixed | Air, steam, oxygen |

### Changes of State
Materials can change from one state to another when heated or cooled:
- Ice (solid) → heated → Water (liquid) → heated → Steam (gas)
- Steam (gas) → cooled → Water (liquid) → cooled → Ice (solid)

## Mixtures

When two or more materials are combined **without a chemical reaction**, we get a **mixture**.

- **Salt water** — salt dissolved in water (salt + water)
- **Air** — a mixture of nitrogen, oxygen, carbon dioxide, and other gases
- **Soil** — a mixture of sand, clay, minerals, and organic matter
- **Muddy water** — soil particles mixed in water

### Separating Mixtures
Mixtures can be separated by various methods:
- **Filtration** — separates insoluble solids from liquid (e.g., muddy water through filter paper)
- **Evaporation** — separates dissolved solids from water by heating (e.g., getting salt from salt water)
- **Sieving** — separates particles of different sizes (e.g., flour from bran)
- **Magnetic separation** — uses a magnet to remove iron particles from a mixture (e.g., iron filings from sand)
- **Decantation** — carefully pouring liquid off a settled solid (e.g., clear water from muddy water after settlement)

## Materials and Their Uses

Choosing the right material for a job depends on its properties:

| Object | Material | Why This Material? |
|--------|----------|--------------------|
| Cooking pans | Steel / aluminium | Good conductors of heat, hard, do not rust easily |
| Electrical wires | Copper | Excellent conductor of electricity |
| Window panes | Glass | Transparent, hard |
| Raincoat | PVC / nylon | Waterproof, flexible |
| Handle of iron pan | Wood / plastic | Insulators (do not conduct heat) |
| Jewellery | Gold / silver | Lustrous, do not corrode |
| Tyres | Rubber | Flexible, waterproof, strong |
| Bricks and buildings | Cement, stone, brick | Hard, rigid, durable |

## Recyclable and Non-Recyclable Materials

- **Recyclable** materials can be collected and reprocessed to make new products.
  - Paper, glass, metals, some plastics
- **Non-recyclable** materials cannot easily be reprocessed.
  - Some multi-layer plastics, contaminated materials

> **Think about it:** Reducing and reusing materials is even better than recycling — it saves energy and resources.
