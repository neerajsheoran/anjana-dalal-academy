          ],
          "answer": "They are insulators and do not conduct heat",
          "explanation": "Wood and plastic are insulators — they do not conduct heat, so the handle stays cool even when the pan is hot."

          "options": [],
          "answer": "Transparent: allows all light through clearly (e.g., clear glass). Translucent: allows some light through but scatters it (e.g., frosted glass, butter paper). Opaque: allows no light through (e.g., wood, metal sheet).",
          "explanation": "The difference lies in how much and how clearly light passes through the material."

          "question": "Why are different materials used for different parts of a cooking pan? Explain with reference to their properties.",
          "options": [],
          "answer": "The base and sides of the pan are made of steel or aluminium because they are good conductors of heat, allowing heat to spread evenly for cooking. The handle is made of wood or plastic because they are insulators — they do not conduct heat, keeping the handle safe to hold. This shows how different properties of materials are used for different purposes.",
          "explanation": "Choosing the right material for each part of an object depends on the properties needed: heat conduction for the body, heat insulation for the handle."

          "question": "List the three states of matter and one characteristic of each. Give an example for each state.",
          "options": [],
          "answer": "Solid: fixed shape and fixed volume (e.g., ice). Liquid: no fixed shape but fixed volume — takes the shape of its container (e.g., water). Gas: no fixed shape and no fixed volume — spreads to fill any container (e.g., steam/water vapour).",
          "explanation": "The state of matter depends on how closely particles are packed and how freely they can move."

          ],
          "answer": "Filtration",
          "explanation": "Sand does not dissolve in water (it is insoluble). Filtration traps sand particles in filter paper while water passes through."

          "options": [],
          "answer": "A mixture is a combination of two or more substances that are not chemically combined. Examples: salt water (salt + water), air (nitrogen + oxygen + other gases), soil (sand + clay + minerals).",
          "explanation": "In a mixture, the components retain their individual properties and can be separated by physical methods."

          ],
          "answer": "Magnetic separation",
          "explanation": "Iron is magnetic; sand is not. Passing a magnet through the mixture attracts iron filings, leaving sand behind."

          "options": [],
          "answer": "Method: Evaporation. Steps: Pour salt water into an evaporating dish. Heat it gently. As water evaporates (turns to vapour), salt crystals are left behind in the dish. The dry salt can then be collected.",
          "explanation": "Evaporation works because water has a much lower boiling point than salt. When heated, water turns to vapour and escapes, leaving salt behind."

          "question": "A mixture contains iron filings, salt, and sand. Describe step by step how you would separate all three components.",
          "options": [],
          "answer": "Step 1 — Magnetic separation: Use a magnet to remove iron filings from the mixture. Step 2 — Add water and stir: Salt dissolves in water but sand does not. Step 3 — Filtration: Filter the mixture to separate sand (stays on filter paper) from salt water (passes through). Step 4 — Evaporation: Heat the salt water to evaporate water, leaving dry salt behind. Result: Iron filings, sand, and salt are all separated.",
          "explanation": "Each step exploits a different property: magnetism for iron, solubility for salt, insolubility for sand."
