          "options": [],
          "answer": "Our sense of touch depends on our body’s current temperature. The same object can feel cold to one person and warm to another depending on what temperature they were exposed to before. So touch gives relative (not absolute) information, making it unreliable for accurate measurement.",
          "explanation": "As shown in the story of Lambok and Phiban, the same bucket of water felt different to two people who had been in different temperature environments."

          ],
          "answer": "−10°C to 110°C",
          "explanation": "A laboratory thermometer has a wider range (−10°C to 110°C) to cover the temperatures encountered in experiments. A clinical thermometer has a narrow range of 35°C to 42°C."

          "question": "What is the purpose of the kink in a clinical thermometer?",
          "options": [],
          "answer": "The kink (a bend in the glass tube near the bulb) prevents the mercury from flowing back into the bulb when the thermometer is removed from the patient’s body. This allows the reading to remain fixed so it can be read accurately after removal.",
          "explanation": "Without the kink, mercury would slide back down as soon as the thermometer cools, making it impossible to read the temperature after removing it from the patient."

          "options": [],
          "answer": "273.15",
          "explanation": "K = °C + 273.15. So 0°C = 273.15 K and 100°C = 373.15 K."

          "question": "What is the difference between heat and temperature? Give one example to illustrate.",
          "options": [],
          "answer": "Temperature is a measure of how hot or cold an object is (measured in °C, °F, or K with a thermometer). Heat is a form of energy that flows from a hotter object to a cooler one (measured in joules with a calorimeter). Example: A burning matchstick has a higher temperature than a large pot of warm water, but the pot of warm water contains far more heat energy because it is much larger.",
          "explanation": "Temperature tells us how hot something is; heat is the total thermal energy an object contains. A small hot flame has high temperature but little total heat."

          "options": [],
          "answer": "(a) Kelvin: K = 37 + 273.15 = 310.15 K. (b) Fahrenheit: °F = (37 × 9/5) + 32 = 66.6 + 32 = 98.6°F.",
          "explanation": "Use K = °C + 273.15 for Celsius to Kelvin. Use °F = (°C × 9/5) + 32 for Celsius to Fahrenheit."

          "options": [],

          "options": [],
          "answer": "If the bulb touches the container’s bottom, it measures the temperature of the container rather than the liquid inside it. The container may be hotter or cooler than the liquid, giving an incorrect reading.",
          "explanation": "The thermometer bulb must be surrounded by the substance being measured (not touching any surface) to give an accurate reading."

          "options": [],
          "answer": "Clinical thermometer: Range 35–42°C; Has a kink to hold the reading; Can be read after removing from the patient. Laboratory thermometer: Range −10°C to 110°C; No kink; Must be read while the bulb is still in the substance being measured.",
          "explanation": "The clinical thermometer is designed for body temperature measurement with safety features; the laboratory thermometer is designed for experiment use with a wider range."
