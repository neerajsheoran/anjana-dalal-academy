## Feeling Hot or Cold?

Have you ever touched a glass of cold water on a summer day and felt instant relief? Or placed your hand near a hot cup of tea? Our body uses the sense of **touch** to judge whether something is hot or cold. But is touch always reliable?

> **Story:** Lambok and Phiban, two friends from Shillong, visited different places. Lambok went to a hot desert, Phiban went to a cold hill station. When they dipped their hands into the same bucket of water, Lambok said “It’s cold!” and Phiban said “It’s warm!” — yet it was the same water!

This tells us that our sense of touch is **not reliable** for measuring hotness or coldness. We need a proper scientific measure — **temperature**.

## What is Temperature?

**Temperature** is the measure of how hot or cold an object is.

- A higher temperature means the object is **hotter**.
- A lower temperature means the object is **colder**.

Temperature is measured using an instrument called a **thermometer**.

The SI unit of temperature is the **kelvin (K)**.

In everyday life, we use **degrees Celsius (°C)** or **degrees Fahrenheit (°F)**.

## Temperature Scales

Three scales are used to measure temperature:

| Scale | Unit Symbol | Used For |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| Celsius | °C | Weather, medicine, science labs |
| Fahrenheit | °F | Body temperature (in some countries), weather (USA) |
| Kelvin | K | Science (SI unit) |

### Important Reference Points

| Condition | Celsius (°C) | Fahrenheit (°F) | Kelvin (K) |
|-----------|-------------|----------------|-----------|
| Freezing point of water | 0 | 32 | 273.15 |
| Boiling point of water | 100 | 212 | 373.15 |
| Normal human body temperature | 37.0 | 98.6 | 310.15 |

### Converting Between Scales

> **Celsius to Kelvin:** K = °C + 273.15
> **Celsius to Fahrenheit:** °F = (°C × 9/5) + 32

### Absolute Zero

The lowest possible temperature is **−273.15°C**, called **absolute zero**. It equals **0 K** on the Kelvin scale. At this temperature, particles stop moving entirely. Nothing can be colder than absolute zero.

## Measuring Temperature — Thermometers

A **thermometer** is an instrument used to measure temperature.

### 1. Clinical Thermometer

A **clinical thermometer** is used to measure human body temperature.

**Features:**
- Has a narrow range — usually **35°C to 42°C** (because normal body temperature is around 37°C)
- Has a **kink** (a bend in the glass tube near the bulb) that prevents mercury from falling back, so you can read it after removing from the body
- Must be washed and shaken down after each use (for mercury type)
- **Digital clinical thermometers** are now more commonly used — they beep when done and display the reading on a screen

**How to use:**
1. Wash the thermometer and shake mercury down below 35°C (or switch on digital)
2. Place the bulb under the tongue (or in the armpit)
3. Wait for about 1–2 minutes
4. Read the temperature (digital: read the display)

**Normal body temperature:** 37.0°C (98.6°F)

> A person has a fever if their temperature is consistently above **37.5°C**.

### 2. Laboratory Thermometer

A **laboratory thermometer** is used in science experiments.

**Features:**
- Wider range — typically **−10°C to 110°C**
- Smallest division on scale: **1°C**
- No kink — must be read while still in the substance
- Should be held upright and not placed on the bottom of the container

**How to use:**
1. Hold the thermometer vertically in the liquid (do not let bulb touch the bottom)
2. Wait until the reading becomes steady
3. Read at eye level to avoid parallax error

---

### 3. Maximum–Minimum Thermometer

Used to record the **highest and lowest temperatures** over a period of time (e.g., in weather stations).

---

### 4. Measuring Air Temperature

The thermometer used to measure outdoor air (atmospheric) temperature is kept in a **Stevenson Screen** — a white louvred box that:
- Shields the thermometer from direct sunlight
- Allows free flow of air
- Is placed at a standard height above the ground

## Reading a Thermometer Correctly

When reading a thermometer:

1. **Keep it at eye level** — looking up or down causes **parallax error**
2. **For laboratory thermometer** — read while bulb is still in the substance
3. **Count the scale divisions carefully** — each small division may be 0.5°C or 1°C

> **Activity:** Take a laboratory thermometer and measure the temperature of:
> - Cold water from the fridge
> - Water at room temperature
> - Warm water from a tap
>
> Record your readings in a table and compare. Which is hottest? Which is coldest?

## Heat vs Temperature

Students often confuse heat and temperature. They are different:

| | Heat | Temperature |
|--|------|------------|
| **What it is** | A form of energy | A measure of hotness/coldness |
| **Unit** | Joule (J) | Kelvin (K) or Celsius (°C) |
| **Measured by** | Calorimeter | Thermometer |
| **Example** | A matchstick has less heat than a large pot of warm water, even if the flame is hotter | The flame has higher temperature but less total heat energy |

## Anna Mani — The Weather Woman of India

**Anna Mani (1918–2001)** was an Indian physicist and meteorologist. She worked at the **India Meteorological Department** and made major contributions to weather instrumentation — designing and calibrating meteorological instruments that measure wind, solar radiation, and atmospheric pressure.

She was a pioneer in weather science in India and is celebrated as the **“Weather Woman of India”**. Her work shows how important accurate measurement of temperature and other atmospheric conditions is for weather forecasting.
