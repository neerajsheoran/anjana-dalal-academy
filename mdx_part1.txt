## Feeling Hot or Cold?

Have you ever touched a glass of cold water on a summer day and felt instant relief? Or placed your hand near a hot cup of tea? Our body uses the sense of **touch** to judge whether something is hot or cold. But is touch always reliable?

> **Story:** Lambok and Phiban, two friends from Shillong, visited different places. Lambok went to a hot desert, Phiban went to a cold hill station. When they dipped their hands into the same bucket of water, Lambok said “It's cold!” and Phiban said “It's warm!” — yet it was the same water!

This tells us that our sense of touch is **not reliable** for measuring hotness or coldness. We need a proper scientific measure — **temperature**.

## What is Temperature?

**Temperature** is the measure of how hot or cold an object is.

- A higher temperature means the object is **hotter**.
- A lower temperature means the object is **colder**.

Temperature is measured using an instrument called a **thermometer**.

The SI unit of temperature is the **kelvin (K)**.

In everyday life, we use **degrees Celsius (°C)** or **degrees Fahrenheit (°F)**.
